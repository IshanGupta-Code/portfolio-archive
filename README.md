# [My Portfolio Archive] (https://vercel.com/ishan-guptas-projects-23b9c18f/portfolio-archive/4MXeYtSa26rw6RGGA6ioqqRYZMTm)

Welcome to my portfolio archive! This is a full-stack portfolio application where I showcase my work and share information about myself. I've built both the frontend and backend components to create a comprehensive platform that represents my skills and projects.

## Overview

I created this portfolio as a comprehensive platform where visitors can explore my work, projects, and learn more about me. I've structured the application with a clean separation between frontend and backend, which makes it scalable and easy for me to maintain and update.

## Project Structure

```
